I've put all elements of the image in this folder with PNG's of the elements themselves and a mouse over state, which is just the same image but a different color lol.
However you put it together on the site is up to you, it doesn't have to be exactly as the example image. 
If you wanna experiment with some other stuff, you could try thinking of things to do when you click on the element.
Things to try:
	Click on book for a text box
	Click on stereo to bring up something music related (spotify playlist?)
	Another item can pull up a hyperlink when clicked.
